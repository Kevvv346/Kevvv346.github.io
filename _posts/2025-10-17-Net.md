🍿 Grab your popcorn — today we’re not watching Netflix, we’re **analyzing it**!

I pulled in the Netflix dataset and started exploring what makes this streaming giant tick. Here are some of the stories hiding in the rows and columns.

## 🎬 Who Runs the Show?

One of the first questions: does Netflix have more movies or TV shows?

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("netflix_titles.csv")

# Count shows vs movies
content_counts = df['type'].value_counts()

# Plot
content_counts.plot(kind='bar', color=['#E50914', '#221F1F'])
plt.title("Movies vs TV Shows on Netflix")
plt.xlabel("Type")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```

📽️ **Movies dominate (~70%)**, while 📺 **TV shows make up ~30%**.
So Netflix is still more like a digital cinema than a traditional TV channel.

## 🌍 Where in the World?

Which countries create the most Netflix content?

```python
# Count by country (first listed country only)
df['country'] = df['country'].fillna('Unknown')
top_countries = df['country'].str.split(',').str[0].value_counts().head(10)

# Plot
top_countries.plot(kind='barh', color='#E50914')
plt.title("Top 10 Content-Producing Countries on Netflix")
plt.xlabel("Number of Titles")
plt.ylabel("Country")
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.show()
```

🌍 The U.S., India, and the U.K. lead, but Netflix pulls titles from **100+ countries**.

## ⏰ The Release Boom

When did Netflix’s content really take off?

```python
# Count releases by year
release_years = df['release_year'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Plot
release_years.plot(kind='line', marker='o', color='#221F1F')
plt.title("Netflix Releases Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Number of Titles")
plt.show()
```

📈 There’s a massive spike after **2015**, peaking around 2019 — the era when Netflix fully became a streaming powerhouse.

## 🔍 So What?

This quick dive reveals:

* Netflix is **still movie-heavy**, but TV originals are growing fast.
* **International content** is central to its strategy.
* The **post-2015 explosion** shows how streaming reshaped entertainment.

## 📊 Final Thought

Data is like a plot twist — you don’t always see it coming until you dig in.

So next time you’re binging *Stranger Things*, remember: behind every title is a dataset waiting to be explored. 😉
