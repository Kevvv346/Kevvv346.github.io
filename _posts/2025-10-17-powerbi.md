## 🏨 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a hotel’s business performance using Power BI to uncover insights that drive smarter, data-backed decisions.
The main goal was to visualize trends in bookings, revenue, and occupancy rates — helping management spot patterns and optimize operations.

## 🎯 Objectives
Understand hotel booking trends and customer behavior.

Identify revenue patterns across months and room types.

Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for real-time insights.

Present key KPIs to management through clear visual storytelling.

## 🧹 Data Preparation
The raw dataset contained multiple CSV files covering:

Booking details (check-in/check-out)

Customer demographics

Room pricing and occupancy

Key Steps:
Imported and transformed data using Power Query.

Cleaned missing values and standardized date/time formats.

Created calculated columns for Total Revenue and Average Stay Duration.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
The final dashboard includes:

KPI Cards: Total Revenue, Occupancy Rate, and Average Stay Duration

Trend Charts: Monthly revenue growth and customer booking frequency

Slicers: Filter by room type, booking source, and customer country

Pie & Bar Charts: Revenue breakdown by room category

📈 Together, these visuals offer a 360° view of hotel performance and guest behavior.

## 🧠 Insights Discovered
Weekends consistently show a 20% increase in bookings.

Premium rooms contribute over 45% of total revenue despite fewer bookings.

Seasonal peaks in December and August align with major holidays.

These insights helped the hotel adjust its pricing and marketing strategies to match demand trends.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
🟡 Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, DAX, and visualization

🟢 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning

🔵 Excel – Initial exploration and sanity checks

🧮 DAX Formulas – Dynamic KPI and measure creation

## 📁 Results
The final Power BI dashboard enabled management to:

Track performance by category, room type, and season

Identify high-value customers and peak booking periods

Make informed, data-driven decisions for growth and optimization

## 🚀 Next Steps
Future improvements include:

Integrating real-time booking data via API or SQL.

Expanding visuals with forecasting models to predict demand trends.

## ✨ Final Thoughts
This Power BI project proves that visualization isn’t just about charts — it’s about translating data into decisions.
When insights become actionable, that’s when analytics truly shines. 💡

Stay tuned for more projects where data meets design, and every dashboard tells a story. 📊
